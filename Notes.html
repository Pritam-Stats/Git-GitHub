    <h2 style="color: rgb(13, 221, 65);">Git Commands</h2>
    <pre>
    1. git clone <Repo https link> [to get the repo in our local]
    2. git status [This will show if you change anything after cloning]
        - Your Branch is up to date (If you haven't changed anything)
        - modified: [a message will show if you change anything so now the github file and your file is different]
        - Untracked file [When you create a new file in the clone repo. But Git won't track this file]
        - staged [Added the changes but not committed]

    3. After changing something whether modifying or creating new file we can ADD that. after adding the changes the status will be "staged"
    4. Then we can add the files which is the middle stage of untracked and commit. To stage the file we use 
        - git add <file name>
        - after adding the git status command will give a message as staged
        - to add all the files at once use <git add .>

    5. Now the Final is to COMMIT using <git commit -m "Write your meaningful message">
